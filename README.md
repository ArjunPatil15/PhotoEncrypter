# ðŸ“·PhotoEncrypter

**PhotoEncrypter** is a Java Swing-based desktop application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt image files using a simple XOR operation and a numeric key. It offers a basic graphical interface for selecting an image and applying the encryption in just a few clicks.

## About

This tool demonstrates how XOR-based encryption works by scrambling the bytes of an image file using a user-provided key. The same key can be used again to reverse the encryption and restore the original image.

> Note: This is a basic method and not suitable for secure encryption. It's meant for educational purposes only.

## How to Use

- Enter a numeric key (e.g., 123) in the text field.
- Click on the **"Open Image"** button.
- Select an image file from your computer.
- The image will be encrypted or decrypted based on the key.
- A confirmation message will be shown once the operation is done.
